# pythonProject1

## 

To begin, the project will integrate with an API to retrieve the necessary data. This data will then undergo transformation and manipulation to make it suitable for storage and analysis. The transformed data will be loaded into a database, ensuring that the information is organized and easily accessible for querying and analysis purposes.
The results of these queries will be utilized to gain valuable insights and support decision-making processes.
To visualize and present the analyzed data, the project will employ Django, a powerful web framework. Using Django, a web page will be created to display the analytical insights in a user-friendly manner. The page will provide interactive visualizations, charts, and graphs to effectively communicate the findings derived from the collected and analyzed data.
